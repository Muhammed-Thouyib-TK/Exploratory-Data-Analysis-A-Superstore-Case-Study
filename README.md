# Exploratory Data Analysis : A Superstore Case Study

Unlocking Business Insights from Real-World Sales 

## 📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular **Superstore Sales dataset**. The objective is to uncover **actionable insights**, assess **sales and profitability trends**, and identify **key business opportunities** using data-driven techniques.

This case study is part of my journey to strengthen practical skills in data analysis and demonstrate how data can influence decision-making in retail and e-commerce sectors.
